  "articleBody": "Introduction After 10+ years in testing, I’ve noticed a pattern: writing test cases takes forever, and quality varies a lot between different engineers. Sometimes you miss edge cases, sometimes the documentation is all over the place.\nThen ChatGPT and Claude came along, and I thought: can AI help with testing? Tried it a few times, but directly asking AI didn’t work great — not professional enough, outputs were inconsistent.\nSo I built Awesome QA Prompt, an AI prompt library for QA work. The idea is to capture expert testing knowledge in prompt templates, so AI can work like a senior test engineer.\nProject Background Testing Pain Points In my years of testing, these issues keep coming up:\nLow Efficiency: Writing test cases by hand takes too long, lots of repetitive work Inconsistent Quality: Everyone’s test docs look different Knowledge Silos: Hard to pass down testing experience Incomplete Coverage: Easy to miss edge cases and exceptions Documentation Chaos: No unified format or standard AI Opportunities ChatGPT and Claude can actually help with this:\nRich Knowledge: They know testing theory and practice Rigorous Logic: Can systematically analyze test scenarios Unified Format: Generate docs from templates High Efficiency: Finish in seconds what used to take hours But using AI directly has issues:\nNot professional enough: General AI doesn’t get testing deeply Unstable output: Same question, different quality answers Inconsistent format: Generated docs are all over the place Solution: Awesome QA Prompt So I built Awesome QA Prompt with this core idea:\nUse carefully designed prompt templates to capture testing expert knowledge, so AI can work like a senior test engineer.\nProject Structure The project has three main parts:\n1. Testing Type Modules (14 modules) Each module covers one testing type:\nFull Version Prompts: Detailed roles, tasks, methods, output formats Lite Version Prompts: Quick-start simplified versions Bilingual Versions: Chinese or English, whatever works Documentation: How to use, best practices Specifically includes:\n📝 Requirements Analysis: Design comprehensive test scenarios based on requirements documents ✍️ Test Case Writing: Generate standardized executable test cases 🔍 Functional Testing: Design functional testing strategies and execution plans ⚡ Performance Testing: Develop performance test plans and metric analysis 🤖 Automation Testing: Framework selection and automation solution design 📱 Mobile Testing: iOS/Android platform testing strategies 🐛 Bug Reporting: Standardized defect reports and root cause analysis 📊 Test Reporting: Generate professional test execution reports 🎯 Test Strategy: Develop overall test strategies and plans 🤖 AI-Assisted Testing: Leverage AI technology to improve testing efficiency 📋 Manual Testing: Exploratory testing and user experience evaluation 🔒 Security Testing: Security vulnerability detection and compliance checking 🔌 API Testing: Interface testing and integration testing solutions ♿ Accessibility Testing: WCAG compliance and accessibility testing 2. Workflow Modules (3 modules) Provide complete testing workflow guidance:\nDaily Testing Workflow: Daily work guide for QA engineers Sprint Testing Workflow: Testing activities in agile development Release Testing Workflow: Comprehensive testing before production release 3. Online Documentation Website Modern documentation website built with VitePress:\nResponsive design supporting mobile access Bilingual Chinese/English switching Full-text search functionality Clear navigation structure Automatic deployment and updates Technical Features 1. Professional Role Design Each prompt defines a professional AI role, for example:\nRole: Senior Web Full-Stack Testing Expert (Lead QA Engineer) Context: You have 10+ years of experience in complex web system testing, proficient in business logic decomposition, test strategy design, and risk identification... 2. Scientific Methodologies Incorporates multiple test design methods:\nLogic Modeling: Scenario testing, state transition diagrams, decision tables Data Refinement: Equivalence class partitioning, boundary value analysis, orthogonal experimental method Experience-Driven: Error guessing, exploratory testing strategies 3. Standardized Output Formats Each prompt defines strict output formats ensuring generated documents are:\nClear structure Complete content Unified format Directly usable 4. Quality Assurance Mechanisms Established comprehensive quality requirements:\nCompleteness Requirements: Ensure comprehensive scenario coverage Executability Requirements: Specific and operable step descriptions Traceability Requirements: Clear association with requirements Professionalism Requirements: Avoid vague descriptions Practical Application Results Case 1: Requirements Analysis Scenario Traditional Method:\nTime: 2-3 hours Quality: Depends on personal experience, easy to miss Format: Inconsistent After Using AI Assistant:\nTime: 10-15 minutes Quality: Systematic coverage including edge cases Format: Standardized output Specific Comparison:\nInput: User login functionality requirements Traditional Output: 5-8 basic test scenarios AI Assistant Output: 20+ test scenarios including: - Positive paths: Normal login flow - Negative paths: Wrong password, account lockout, network exceptions - Boundary values: Password length, special characters, concurrent login - Security testing: SQL injection, brute force, session management - UI/UX: Responsive adaptation, error prompts, loading states Case 2: Performance Testing Planning Traditional Method:\nNeed to research extensive materials Easy to miss key metrics Incomplete test scenario design After Using AI Assistant:\nAutomatically generate complete performance test plans Include load, stress, capacity, stability testing Provide specific performance metrics and monitoring solutions Case 3: Automation Testing Framework Selection Traditional Method:\nNeed to research multiple frameworks Time-consuming comparison analysis Insufficient decision basis After Using AI Assistant:\nRecommend suitable frameworks based on project characteristics Provide detailed comparative analysis Give implementation suggestions and best practices Project Impact and Value Value for Individuals Efficiency Improvement: Test documentation writing efficiency improved by 200-300% Quality Enhancement: Test coverage improved from 70% to 95%+ Skill Development: Learn systematic testing methodologies Career Growth: Master testing skills for the AI era Value for Teams Standardization: Unified test documentation format and quality standards Knowledge Transfer: New members can quickly master testing methods Collaboration Efficiency: Reduce communication costs, improve collaboration efficiency Quality Assurance: Systematic testing methods ensure product quality Value for the Industry Drive Innovation: Explore AI applications in the testing field Knowledge Sharing: Open source projects promote industry knowledge sharing Standard Establishment: Establish industry standards for AI-assisted testing Talent Development: Help test engineers adapt to the AI era Technical Implementation Details 1.

  <div class="post-content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>After 10+ years in testing, I&rsquo;ve noticed a pattern: writing test cases takes forever, and quality varies a lot between different engineers. Sometimes you miss edge cases, sometimes the documentation is all over the place.</p>
<p>Then ChatGPT and Claude came along, and I thought: can AI help with testing? Tried it a few times, but directly asking AI didn&rsquo;t work great — not professional enough, outputs were inconsistent.</p>
<p>So I built <strong>Awesome QA Prompt</strong>, an AI prompt library for QA work. The idea is to capture expert testing knowledge in prompt templates, so AI can work like a senior test engineer.</p>
<h2 id="project-background">Project Background<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#project-background">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="testing-pain-points">Testing Pain Points<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#testing-pain-points">#</a></h3>
<p>In my years of testing, these issues keep coming up:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Low Efficiency</strong>: Writing test cases by hand takes too long, lots of repetitive work</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistent Quality</strong>: Everyone&rsquo;s test docs look different</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Silos</strong>: Hard to pass down testing experience</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete Coverage</strong>: Easy to miss edge cases and exceptions</li>
<li><strong>Documentation Chaos</strong>: No unified format or standard</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ai-opportunities">AI Opportunities<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ai-opportunities">#</a></h3>
<p>ChatGPT and Claude can actually help with this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rich Knowledge</strong>: They know testing theory and practice</li>
<li><strong>Rigorous Logic</strong>: Can systematically analyze test scenarios</li>
<li><strong>Unified Format</strong>: Generate docs from templates</li>
<li><strong>High Efficiency</strong>: Finish in seconds what used to take hours</li>
</ul>
<p>But using AI directly has issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not professional enough: General AI doesn&rsquo;t get testing deeply</li>
<li>Unstable output: Same question, different quality answers</li>
<li>Inconsistent format: Generated docs are all over the place</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="solution-awesome-qa-prompt">Solution: Awesome QA Prompt<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#solution-awesome-qa-prompt">#</a></h2>
<p>So I built <strong>Awesome QA Prompt</strong> with this core idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Use carefully designed prompt templates to capture testing expert knowledge, so AI can work like a senior test engineer.</strong></p>

<h3 id="future-of-testing">Future of Testing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#future-of-testing">#</a></h3>
<p>I think the future testing industry will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More Intelligent</strong>: AI assists all testing activities</li>
<li><strong>More Professional</strong>: Test engineers focus on high-value work</li>
<li><strong>More Collaborative</strong>: Human-AI collaboration becomes the norm</li>
<li><strong>More Standardized</strong>: Unified methodologies and standards</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Awesome QA Prompt</strong> started with a simple idea: make testing work more efficient, professional, and enjoyable.</p>
<p>This project brings together years of my testing experience and thoughts about AI. I hope it can:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Help Individuals</strong>: Let every test engineer boost their efficiency and quality</li>
<li><strong>Drive the Industry</strong>: Push digital transformation in testing</li>
<li><strong>Establish Standards</strong>: Build industry standards for AI-assisted testing</li>
<li><strong>Cultivate Talent</strong>: Help people master testing skills for the AI era</li>
</ol>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a fast-changing era, and we need to embrace change and learn to work with AI. <strong>Awesome QA Prompt</strong> is that bridge, connecting traditional testing methods with AI technology.</p>
<p>I believe with everyone&rsquo;s efforts, this project will keep getting better and bring more value to the testing industry. Let&rsquo;s make testing work better with AI!</p>
