API, which stands for Application Programming Interface, is a computing interface that defines the interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It specifies the types of calls or requests that can be made, how they are made, the data format to be used, and the conventions to be followed. APIs can also provide extension mechanisms, allowing users to extend existing functionalities in various ways. An API can be custom-made for a specific component or designed based on industry standards to ensure interoperability. By hiding information, APIs enable modular programming, allowing users to work independently using interfaces.\nWhat is API Testing? API testing is a type of software testing that includes two types: specifically testing the functionality of Application Programming Interfaces (referred to as API) and, more broadly, testing the overall functionality, reliability, security, and performance in integration testing by invoking APIs.\nAPI Best Practice:\nAPI definition follows the RESTful API style, with semantic URI definitions, accurate HTTP status codes, and the ability to understand the relationships between resources through API definitions. Detailed and accurate API documentation (such as Swagger documentation). External APIs may include version numbers for quick iteration (e.g., https://thoughtworks.com/v1/users/). Testing in different quadrants of the testing pyramid has different purposes and strategies. API testing mainly resides in the second and fourth quadrants.\nAPI testing holds a relatively high position in the testing pyramid, focusing on testing functionality and business logic at the boundaries of systems and services. It is executed after the service is built and deployed in the testing environment for validation.\nTypes of API Testing Functional Testing\nCorrectness Testing Exception Handling Internal Logic … Non-functional Testing\nPerformance Security … Steps in API Testing Send Request Get Response Verify Response Result Introduction to Postman and Newman Postman is a popular API development tool that provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for creating, testing, and debugging APIs.
