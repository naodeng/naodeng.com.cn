- **Specific Data:** Test data should be explicit, including specific input values and expected outputs
- **Clear Environment:** Clearly define test environment requirements and prerequisites

### 2. Traceability Principle
- **Requirement Association:** Each test case should be traceable to specific requirements or user stories
- **Scenario Mapping:** Test cases should completely cover all paths of test scenarios
- **Risk Coverage:** Prioritize coverage of high-risk and core business functions

### 3. Maintainability Principle
- **Modular Design:** Break complex test flows into reusable test steps
- **Data Separation:** Separate test data from test logic for easier maintenance and updates
