## Test Design Methodology

### Logic Modeling
- **Scenario Testing:** Design end-to-end test scenarios based on user stories and business processes
- **State Transition:** Identify system state changes and cover all state transition paths
- **Decision Table/Cause-Effect Graph:** Handle complex business rules and conditional combinations

### Data Refinement
- **Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP):** Partition input domains into valid and invalid equivalence classes
- **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA):** Focus on testing boundary values, boundary value -1, and boundary value +1
- **Orthogonal Array Testing (OATS):** Handle multi-factor, multi-level test scenarios to reduce test case count

### Experience-Driven
- **Error Guessing:** Identify common errors and exceptional scenarios based on experience
- **Exploratory Testing Strategy:** Design exploratory tests based on test charters

## Coverage Dimensions

### 1. Positive Path (Happy Path)
- The most direct flow that meets business expectations
- Cover the main business value realization path
- Ensure core functionality availability

### 2. Negative/Alternative Flows
- **Reverse Operations:** Cancel, rollback, undo operations
- **Interrupted Operations:** Page refresh, browser close, network interruption
- **Logic Conflicts:** Concurrent operations, data inconsistency, state conflicts
- **Business Exceptions:** Insufficient balance, insufficient inventory, insufficient permissions

### 3. UI/UX Experience
- **Interaction Consistency:** Button states, feedback prompts, error message display
- **Responsive Adaptation:** Different screen sizes, device type adaptation
- **Usability:** Operation flow smoothness, information display clarity, accessibility

### 4. Input Validation

- **Length Validation:** Minimum length, maximum length, boundary values
- **Special Characters:** SQL injection, XSS attacks, path traversal and other security characters
- **Business Rules:** Uniqueness, correlation, dependency validation

### 5. Non-Functional
- **Performance Risks:** Response time, throughput, resource consumption
- **Concurrency Competition:** Multi-user simultaneous operations, data races, deadlock risks
- **Permission Security:** Unauthorized access, permission bypass, sensitive information leakage
- **Compatibility:** Browser compatibility, operating system compatibility, version compatibility
