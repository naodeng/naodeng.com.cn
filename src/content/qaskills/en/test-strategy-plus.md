- description: Use this skill when you need a structured test strategy from requirement, analysis, tech, and plan docs; triggers include test strategy plus and advanced test strategy.

## When to Use

- Need a fuller strategy with milestones, gates, ownership, and tradeoffs.
- Need a stronger planning artifact than the base strategy version.

## Workflow

1. Read and follow the main prompt listed under Progressive disclosure (coverage, structure, quality bar).
2. Direct requirements, analysis, technical, and plan materials remain sufficient for standalone use. Role reports with a declared `source_role` are optional composition inputs and never require installing a role Skill.
3. Add only project context that changes the result: scope, environment, constraints, risks, dependencies, expected deliverable.
4. If input is incomplete, return a usable first draft and explicitly mark assumptions and gaps.
5. Default to Markdown; switch formats only when the user asks.

## Core Constraints

- Prioritize by risk / business impact — do not treat everything equally.
- Separate confirmed facts from current assumptions.
- Do not invent endpoints, fields, environments, or root causes the user did not provide.
- Preserve source-role attribution when using role reports, and keep delivery constraints, quality facts/conclusions, and risk acceptance separate.
- A Project Manager may supply schedule, resources, dependencies, and action tracking, but these cannot rewrite quality conclusions, test facts, or risk acceptance. Consume report content only; do not depend on role Skill internals.
- Keep output executable: concrete scenarios, clear priority, clear next steps.

## Progressive Disclosure

- Before producing output, read and follow `prompts/test-strategy-plus.md` (minimum coverage, output structure, quality bar).
- When a ready-made template fits: use matching files under `output-templates/`.
- When the user wants examples or alignment with existing assets: read relevant `examples/`.
- For deep framework/troubleshoot/schema notes: read only the relevant file(s) under `references/`, do not load the whole directory.
- For format conversion or helper checks: prefer existing `scripts/` over reinventing.
- For evaluating/regressing this skill: use `evals/` with skill-up.

## Pre-delivery Checklist

- [ ] Followed the main prompt's output structure
- [ ] Minimum coverage focus: objectives and scope, risk priorities, test methods and depth, resource and ownership plan, milestones, quality gates, entry or exit thinking, environment and data strategy, ... (details in main prompt)
- [ ] Covered the minimum checklist, or explained omissions
- [ ] High-risk items have explicit priority
- [ ] Did not invent details the user did not provide
- [ ] Assumptions and gaps are marked
- [ ] Project Manager schedule/resource/dependency constraints did not override quality conclusions or substitute for authorized risk acceptance
- [ ] Role-report content retains source roles; direct inputs remain sufficient and no role Skill internal file was linked

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not pretend completeness when scope/context is missing.
- Do not treat every item as equally important.
- Do not skip assumptions and information gaps.
- Do not dump generic theory unrelated to the current toolchain.
