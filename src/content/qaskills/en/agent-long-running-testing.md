- description: Use this skill when you need evidence-bounded checkpoints, heartbeats, resume, cancellation, duplicate submission, timeouts, and resource lifecycle; triggers include 长运行 Agent and long-running Agent.

## When to Use

- Use this skill when you need evidence-bounded analysis, design, or validation preparation for checkpoints, heartbeats, resume, cancellation, duplicate submission, timeouts, and resource lifecycle.
- Use it to review an Agent, RAG, or LLM plan, result, or evidence set and produce actionable improvements.
- Use it when context is incomplete but a bounded first pass with assumptions, gaps, and human-decision boundaries is still useful.

## Workflow

1. Read and follow `prompts/agent-long-running-testing.md`, including its input audit, domain coverage, and output order.
2. Extract scope, environment, version, time window, constraints, success criteria, and available evidence, with attention to checkpoint, heartbeat, resume and cancel, duplicate submission, resource lifecycle.
3. Separate confirmed facts, evidence-backed inferences, candidate recommendations, and Human decisions before ranking by risk and evidence strength.
4. Turn high-risk items into preconditions, steps, expected behavior or decision criteria, required evidence, and a validation method.
5. When input is incomplete, deliver a bounded first pass, state unsupported conclusions, and never present static material as execution evidence.

## Core Constraints

- Keep the analysis focused on checkpoints, heartbeats, resume, cancellation, duplicate submission, timeouts, and resource lifecycle; do not replace business owners or Human risk acceptance, exception approval, or safety decisions.
- Never invent system behavior, fields, model outputs, data, thresholds, root causes, execution records, or pass claims.
- Static design, plans, file presence, or a dry run retain their evidence state and cannot become proof of real execution.
- When evidence is insufficient, use pending confirmation, blocked, unassessed, or NOT_SCORED and give the smallest validation method.
- For user data, production, or safety work, use least privilege, masked data, mocks, dry runs, or isolation.

## Common Pitfalls

- Listing checks without triggers, expected concerns, owner roles, close conditions, and evidence.
- Treating adjacent tests or model tools as a complete long-running Agent judgment.
- Using unexplained numbers for false precision or writing correlation as causation.
- Refusing incomplete input, or pretending that incomplete evidence is conclusive.

# Long-Running Agent Testing

## When to Use

- Use this skill when you need evidence-bounded analysis, design, or validation preparation for checkpoints, heartbeats, resume, cancellation, duplicate submission, timeouts, and resource lifecycle.
- Use it to review an Agent, RAG, or LLM plan, result, or evidence set and produce actionable improvements.
- Use it when context is incomplete but a bounded first pass with assumptions, gaps, and human-decision boundaries is still useful.

## Output Format Options

- Default to Markdown organized by domain risk, evidence state, priority, and boundary.
- When the user requests tables, CSV, JSON, or ticket fields, preserve the same finding fields, evidence, and decision boundaries.
- Before machine consumption, confirm the schema, enums, required fields, and evidence sources.

## How to Use

1. Read and follow `prompts/agent-long-running-testing.md`, including its input audit, domain coverage, and output order.
2. Extract scope, environment, version, time window, constraints, success criteria, and available evidence, with attention to checkpoint, heartbeat, resume and cancel, duplicate submission, resource lifecycle.
3. Separate confirmed facts, evidence-backed inferences, candidate recommendations, and Human decisions before ranking by risk and evidence strength.
4. Turn high-risk items into preconditions, steps, expected behavior or decision criteria, required evidence, and a validation method.
5. When input is incomplete, deliver a bounded first pass, state unsupported conclusions, and never present static material as execution evidence.

## Reference Files

- Always read `prompts/agent-long-running-testing.md`; it is the complete execution specification for this skill.
- For evaluation, read `evals/eval.yaml` and the matching cases under `evals/cases/`.
- Load `references/`, `examples/`, `scripts/`, or `output-formats.md` only when those directories exist and the task needs them.

## Core Constraints

- Keep the analysis focused on checkpoints, heartbeats, resume, cancellation, duplicate submission, timeouts, and resource lifecycle; do not replace business owners or Human risk acceptance, exception approval, or safety decisions.
- Never invent system behavior, fields, model outputs, data, thresholds, root causes, execution records, or pass claims.
- Static design, plans, file presence, or a dry run retain their evidence state and cannot become proof of real execution.
- When evidence is insufficient, use pending confirmation, blocked, unassessed, or NOT_SCORED and give the smallest validation method.
- For user data, production, or safety work, use least privilege, masked data, mocks, dry runs, or isolation.

## Delivery Checklist

- [ ] Covered checkpoint, heartbeat, resume and cancel, duplicate submission, resource lifecycle, with source, evidence state, and validation method for each.
- [ ] Separated facts, inferences, candidate recommendations, gaps, and Human decisions.
- [ ] Gave high-risk items P0/P1/P2/P3 or an equivalent priority, owner role, and close condition.
- [ ] Did not turn plans, static checks, or dry runs into test execution, all-passed, or safety-approved claims.
- [ ] Stated residual risk, stop/escalation conditions, and next actions.

## Common Pitfalls

- Listing checks without triggers, expected concerns, owner roles, close conditions, and evidence.
- Treating adjacent tests or model tools as a complete long-running Agent judgment.
- Using unexplained numbers for false precision or writing correlation as causation.
- Refusing incomplete input, or pretending that incomplete evidence is conclusive.

## Best Practices

- Start with paths most likely to cause user harm, business loss, or decision blockage.
- Use the smallest verifiable experiment to reduce uncertainty and record conditions, versions, sources, and evidence.
- Make the Skill independently installable, executable, and reviewable by another engineer.
