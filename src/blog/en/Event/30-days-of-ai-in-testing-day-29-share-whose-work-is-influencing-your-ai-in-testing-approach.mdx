## Day 29: Share whose work is influencing your AI in testing approach

Throughout this 30 days of AI in Testing journey, you’ve been exposed to various concepts, tools, and perspectives related to AI in testing. As we approach the final few tasks, it’s time to reflect on the individuals whose work, ideas and interpretations have resonated with you and influenced your thoughts and approach to AI in testing. By sharing whose work or ways of interpreting AI in testing are useful, we’ll end up with a useful collection of people to follow and whose work to explore beyond this challenge!

### Task Steps

- **Reflect and Recognise**: Think about the voices that have resonated with you during this challenge. Who has provided insights that opened new paths for thought or application in AI and testing? What tools or ways of working have been the most enlightening? Consider the individuals, researchers, experts, tool developers, or peers whose work has shaped your understanding of AI’s role in testing.
- **Compile Your Influences**: Make a list of these individuals and resources. Whether it’s an expert with deep insights into AI, a groundbreaking article or book, an innovative tool, or a fellow participant whose contributions have been enlightening, each has added value to your AI in testing journey.
- **Share and Guide**: In your response to this post, highlight your list of influences, consider including a brief description of their contribution and explain how they have shaped your perspective.
- **Bonus**: Did you know that by contributing to any part of this challenge, you will have undoubtedly influenced others in the community? No matter where you are in your AI in testing journey, you will have useful things to share that can help others in the community. Consider committing to continuing to share your AI in testing learnings even after this challenge is over through personal blogging, [creating content with us](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/contribute), or other channels.

### Why Take Part

- **Curate Valuable Resources**: Help others discover valuable resources to continue learning after the challenge and discover new inspirations and knowledge by engaging with peers’ influences.
- **Reflect on Personal Growth**: Highlighting your influences offers a moment to reflect on how far you’ve come, showcasing the progression of your perspectives and approaches to AI in testing.

## My Day 29 Task

## About Event

The "30 Days of AI in Testing Challenge" is an initiative by the Ministry of Testing community. The last time I came across this community was during their "30 Days of Agile Testing" event.

### Event Introduce

Upgrade Your Testing Game throughout March, with the 30 Days of AI in Testing Challenge!

- March 1 2024 - April 1 2024
- 00:00 - 23:00 BST
- Location: Online

Calling all testers, AI enthusiasts, and anyone curious about how Artificial Intelligence is reshaping software quality. Ready to explore the world of AI? This March, we're launching 30 Days of AI in Testing, and you're invited to join the mission!

### What is it?

Over 30 enlightening days, alongside a vibrant community, you'll embark on a journey to uncover the potential of AI in testing. Each day, we'll explore and discuss new concepts, tools, and practices that will demystify AI and enhance your testing toolkit.

### Why take part?

Incrementally Elevate Your Skills: Each day brings a new, manageable task that builds on the last. Helping you gradually deepen your understanding of AI in testing.
Improve Your Testing Efficiency and Effectiveness: Discover the many ways AI can be used to improve your everyday testing, improving your efficiency and effectiveness.

Connect and Collaborate: Engage with a global community of testers and AI enthusiasts on The Club forum, sharing insights, and gaining inspiration and support.

Achieve AI Ambitions: Use this challenge as a stepping stone to reach your AI testing goals. Dip in and tackle the tasks that meet your AI ambitions.

Lead and Inspire: By sharing your AI journey and discoveries during the challenge, you’ll play a crucial role in advancing the knowledge and skills of the community.

### How will it work?

Throughout March, a member of team MoT will post a new, short, daily task on The Club forum that'll enhance your understanding of AI in testing.

You'll then reply to the topic posts with your responses to each daily task. Feel free to share your thoughts, ask questions, seek advice, or offer support to others.

Finally, don't forget to encourage meaningful discussions by engaging with other people’s replies. If you find someone’s response interesting or helpful, hit that ❤️ button and let them know!

Don't get FOMO; register now! Registering will give you an email reminder for each daily task.
