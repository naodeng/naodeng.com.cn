Dear readers,

Recently, while checking the indexing status of my personal blog articles on search engines, I regret to inform you about a disheartening discovery. I found that my blog articles were blatantly plagiarized by a CSDN blogger who not only copied them verbatim but also failed to provide proper attribution.

I am angered and disappointed by this unethical behavior. I have consistently strived to deliver original and valuable content to all of you, and such plagiarism is a severe disrespect to my hard work and dedication. To protect my rights, I find it necessary to issue this declaration to ensure everyone is aware of the facts.

Firstly, I want to make it clear that I vehemently oppose all forms of plagiarism and infringement. My blog is my personal creative space, intended to be a platform for sharing and communication rather than a target for unauthorized appropriation.

Upon confirming the actions of the CSDN blogger, I feel deep regret and have decided to take all necessary legal measures to safeguard my legitimate rights. Simultaneously, I call upon all bloggers and creators to collaborate in maintaining a positive creative environment and eradicating instances of plagiarism.

Lastly, I want to express my gratitude to all the readers who have supported me throughout. Your support fuels my creativity and empowers me to overcome challenges. I will continue to deliver authentic and valuable content for all of you.

I have contacted CSDN to take it down.

Thank you once again for your attention and support.

Sincerely.
