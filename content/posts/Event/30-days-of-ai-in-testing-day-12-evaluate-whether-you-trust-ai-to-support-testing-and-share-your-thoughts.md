summary: "This blog post is day eleven of the 30 Days of AI Testing Challenge, focusing on the use of AI to generate test data and evaluating its effectiveness. The post may include the author's real-world application of AI-generated test data and an assessment of its effectiveness and applicability. By sharing the application and evaluation of AI-generated test data, readers will understand how the author leverages AI technology to generate valid test data and enhance the efficiency of the testing process in real testing environments. This series of events is expected to provide testing professionals with cases of practical application of AI-generated test data and encourage them to experiment with this emerging technology."

## Day 12: Evaluate whether you trust AI to support testing and share your thoughts

It’s day 12, and it’s time to get reflective about AI’s role in supporting testing and empowering testers. In previous days, we have explored various ways in which AI can currently support testing activities. There are many interesting options, and in many ways, we are only at the start of the AI in Testing journey.

However, the use of AI in any context can be problematic due to issues and limitations such as:

- Data Privacy
- Biased and discriminatory behaviours
- Inaccurate results
- Unexpected and/or emerging behaviours
- Misaligned goals
- Lack of AI explainability

These issues (to name a few) impact our trust in AI, but this is contextual, so let’s explore how much we should trust AI in Testing in your context.

### Task Steps

- **Research AI Risks**: Find and read an introductory article on AI Risks and problems. If you are short on time, try one of these editorials:

  - [The 15 Biggest Risks Of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/06/02/the-15-biggest-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/) - Forbes, Bernard Marr
  - [Challenges of AI](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2022/03/challenges-ai) - Chatham House, Kate Jones, Marjorie Buchser & Jon Wallace

- **Consider the role of AI in Testing**: Consider, for your Testing Context, the ways that AI could be used and then:

  - Identify which AI Risks might impact the quality of testing in your context
  - Examine how one or more of these AI Risks might impact your testing
  - Think about how you might safeguard against these risks becoming issues in your context?
- **Shared your insights**: reply to this post with your reflections on the use of AI in testing. Consider sharing some or all of the following:
  - What context do you work in?
  - What AI risks are introduced or amplified by the introduction of AI in Testing for your context?
  - Where should AI not be used in your testing context?
  - To what extent should the use of AI be trusted in your context?
  - How might trust for AI in Testing be increased in your context?
- **Bonus**: If you are a blogger, why not create a blog post and link that in your response?

### Why Take Part

- **Improve your critical thinking**: The adoption of AI in Testing needs us to balance the benefits of using AI with the risks and issues it introduces. By taking part in this task, you are increasing your awareness of the risks and honing your thinking about these, so you are not dazzled by the AI hype.
