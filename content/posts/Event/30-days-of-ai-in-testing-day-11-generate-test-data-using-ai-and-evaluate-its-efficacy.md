summary: "This blog post is day eleven of the 30 Days of AI Testing Challenge, focusing on the use of AI to generate test data and evaluating its effectiveness. The post may include the author's real-world application of AI-generated test data and an assessment of its effectiveness and applicability. By sharing the application and evaluation of AI-generated test data, readers will understand how the author leverages AI technology to generate valid test data and enhance the efficiency of the testing process in real testing environments. This series of events is expected to provide testing professionals with cases of practical application of AI-generated test data and encourage them to experiment with this emerging technology."

## Day 11: Generate test data using AI and evaluate its efficacy

Day 11 already! Today, we will learn about Test Data Selection and Generation using AI. Data is at the heart of many applications these days, and many tests require us to select or create data that explores the applications’ behaviours. At one end of the scale, this might be a small set of inputs designed to trigger some anticipated system behaviour, and at the other end of the scale, it might require thousands or millions of realistic data points to test the system’s performance or to evaluate an AI model.

Creating realistic data for tests can be a tedious and problematic task a key question is whether we can use AI to **supercharge our Test Data Generation efforts**.

### Task Steps

Today’s task is to pick a tool that generates test data and try it out on a test data generation problem in your context. It could be selecting data to test a behaviour or generating many data points to populate a database.

1. **Select your tool of choice**: Review the tool lists compiled in earlier days and find one you want to try that generates test data. Or you could try generating data using a Large Langague Model such as ChatGPT or CoPilot.

2. **Find a Data Problem to solve**: Select a Test Data Generation problem or challenge. If you don’t have one (lucky you!), make one or ask the community for examples of their data challenges.

3. **Experiment with the tool**: Learn how the tool generates data and try to generate test data for your chosen scenario.

4. **Evaluate the generated data**: Review the quality and completeness of the data generated. Some perspectives you might want to consider are:

   a. How easy was it to generate the data?
   b. How flexible is the data generation?
   c. Did the generated data meet your needs? Was it realistic?

5. **Share your findings**: As always, share your findings with the community so they can benefit from your insights. Consider sharing:

   a. The data problem you were trying to solve and how well you think the tool performed.
   b. Your perceptions about what was positive and negative about the tool and the data generated.
   c. How the generated data might be improved.
   d. How might the tool help with your day-to-day testing activities?

### Why Take Part

- **Learn about new ways to generate test data**: By contributing to the task, you’ll learn about new ways to solve an old problem.
