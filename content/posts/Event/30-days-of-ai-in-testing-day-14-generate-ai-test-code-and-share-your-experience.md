## Day 14: Generate AI test code and share your experience

Nearly at the halfway mark! For Day 14, we want to focus on how AI is being used to build automation. In recent times, there has been a growth in automation tools using AI to simplify the creation or improvement of test code or to (nearly) eliminate the need for knowledge of coding all together (so called Low-Code or No-Code tools). They represent a potentially different way of building automation that could be faster and more robust.

For today’s task, let’s focus on building test code for functional testing… we have other challenges coming up that focus on AI’s impact on other types of testing and topics such as self-healing tests.

### Task Steps

- **Select a tool**: Early in the challenge, we created lists of tools and their features, so review those posts and find a tool that interests you. Here are some tips:
  - If you are not comfortable with building automation, pick a No-Code or Low-Code tool and try creating automation with it. Some examples might be:
    - [Testim](https://www.testim.io/fast-authoring/) 
    - [Kalton](https://katalon.com/web-testing)
    - [Postman AI Assistant](https://blog.postman.com/introducing-postbot-postmans-new-ai-assistant/)
  - If are experienced with building automation, why not try using a code assistant such as CoPilot or Cody AI to assist you in writing some automation.
  - If you have already evaluated a functional automation tool earlier in the challenge, why not pick a different tool and compare the two?
- **Create some test code**: Set a timebox (such as 20-30 mins) and try to build a small example of automation using your tool of choice:
  - Not sure what to use? Try one of these demo applications:
    - Restful Booker [https://automationintesting.online](https://automationintesting.online/)
    - Evil Tester’s [Web Testing and Automation Practice Application Pages](https://testpages.eviltester.com/styled/index.html)
    - Applitools [ACME demo app](https://demo.applitools.com/app.html) 
    - Swag Labs [https://www.saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com/)
    - Petstore [https://petstore.octoperf.com](https://petstore.octoperf.com/) 
- **Share your thoughts**: Reply to this post and share your findings and insights such as:
  - What level of experience you have with functional automation.
  - Which tool you used and the automation you were trying to create.
  - How you found working with the tool to build and update your automation.
  - Did the code work the first time, or did you need further refinement?
  - Did you find any limitations or frustrations with the tool?

### Why Take Part

- **Better understand the direction of AI for automation**: The use of AI in functional automation is expanding, and taking part in this task allows you to gain exposure to these new ways of building automation and their limitations. Sharing your experiences with the community makes us all smarter.
