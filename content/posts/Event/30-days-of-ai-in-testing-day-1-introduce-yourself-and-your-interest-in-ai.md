## My Day 1 Task

<https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/day-1-introduce-yourself-and-your-interest-in-ai/74449/291>

Hello, I’m Nao Deng. You can call me Nao. I am a senior QA at Thoughtworks China.
I have 12 years of experience in hardware testing, system testing, software testing, manual testing, API automation testing, UI automation testing, mobile automation testing, performance testing, and project quality assurance.

I also continuously write articles on my personal blog at https://naodeng.com.cn.

I discovered this community during the 30 Days of Agile Testing event.

AI testing has been a topic of continuous interest to me, from the early days of accurate testing to the current generative AI and big models. I aim to learn and invest in the field of AI testing, and implement effective tools or methods to enhance the efficiency of manual and automated testing, including performance testing and improving quality management efficiency.

The purpose of attending this event is to gain ideas and practical experience from other community members about AI testing, and to explore feasible directions for AI testing with the community.
