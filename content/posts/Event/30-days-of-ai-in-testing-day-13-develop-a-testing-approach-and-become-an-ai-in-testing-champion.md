summary: "This blog post is day eleven of the 30 Days of AI Testing Challenge, focusing on the use of AI to generate test data and evaluating its effectiveness. The post may include the author's real-world application of AI-generated test data and an assessment of its effectiveness and applicability. By sharing the application and evaluation of AI-generated test data, readers will understand how the author leverages AI technology to generate valid test data and enhance the efficiency of the testing process in real testing environments. This series of events is expected to provide testing professionals with cases of practical application of AI-generated test data and encourage them to experiment with this emerging technology."

## Day 13: Develop a testing approach and become an AI in testing champion

Day 13 is here! We’ve covered a lot of ground in a short period of time. We’ve examined various ways that AI could support testing and empower testers. We’ve examined some of the risks inherent in using AI, and we’ve experimented with some tools.

Today, we will focus on how the information we have collected could be used to improve our overall approach to testing. AI in Testing won’t happen by itself - it needs **AI in Testing Champions**.

### Task Steps

- **The As-Is**: Consider your team’s current testing practices, how work flows from feature to delivery, and the role of testing in that flow.
  - Consider testing related activities such as:
    - Test Data Management
    - Test Design
    - Test Planning and execution
    - Managing Defects
    - Test Reporting
  - Which areas are most challenging or time-consuming?
  - Which areas need improving?
- **Where does AI add value?**: Based on your experiences in the challenge so far and using contributions from others, consider:
  - Where would AI add the most value in your workflow?
  - Pick one area of improvement (or more if you want) that you want to focus on
  - How would you use AI in that area, and what would the impact be?
  - What AI Risks does it introduce, and how would you mitigate them?
- **Become an AI in Testing champion**: Imagine you need to convenience your peers, manager or company to invest in AI in Testing. Based on your ideas from the previous tasks, create a visual or short report that outlines your approach.
  - Capture the current citation and challenges(s)
  - Show where AI in Testing could improve the workflow
  - Outline any risks and how they can be mitigated
  - Describe how your proposals will improve the current situation.
- **Share your approach with your fellow AiT Champions**: share your ideas by replying to this post.
  - **Reminder**: Don’t include anything   that is sensitive to your company

### Why Take Part

- **Become an AI in Testing Champion**: The adoption of AI in Testing needs people to understand how it fits into testing and champion its use. This task helps you develop the skills to become an AI in Testing Champion for your organisation.
